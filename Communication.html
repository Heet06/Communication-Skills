            thoughts, messages or information by speech, visuals, signals, writing or 
            behavior. It is the meaningful exchange of information between two groups or a

            <b><u>How is a process of Communication successful?</u></b>
        </p>

        <p class="points">
            Communication is considered successful when the real idea is interpreted from
            the sender to receiver using appropriate channel and meaning of the message is
            clearly understood to the receiver otherwise it is considered as miscommunication.
