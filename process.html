        <p class="explain">
            Communication is a process that involves servel steps and at least two persons.
            The person who sends the message is the sender and the person who receives The
            message is the receiver.Given below are the six steps of communication:
        </p>

        <h3 class="type">
            <b>1.Ideation:</b>
        </h3>

        <p class="points">
            The first step of communication is for the sender to have an idea has to be sent
            to the receiver through a proper channel.This first step is called ideation
        </p>

        <h3 class="type">
            <b>2.Encoding:</b>
        </h3>
        
        <p class="points">
            The idea has to be converted into a message which can then be transmitted, through
            proper symbols and signs which must be proper and comprehensible to the receiver.
            This step is called encoding.</p>

        <h3 class="type">
            <b>3.Channel:</b>
        </h3>

        <p class="points">
            The message must be transmitted through proper channel media/channels.
            The sender must be extremely careful while selecting the mode of transmission so
            there aren't any changes or miscommunication.
        </p>

        <h3 class="type">
            <b>4.Decoding:</b>
        </h3>

        <p class="points">
            In this step, the receiver receives  the message sent by the sender and then understands 
            the original idea. To do this, the receiver will decode the message. This process is called
            decoding. After decoding the message,the idea reaches to the receiver.
        </p>

        <h3 class="type">
            <b>5.Receiving</b>
        </h3>
        
        <p class="points">
            The last step is in the one-way process of communication is receiving
            the idea which the sender earlier had in his mind
        </p>

        <h3 class="type">
            <b>6.Feedback:</b>
        </h3>

        <p class="points">
            In this step of communication, the receiver now has to become the sender end convey back to the
            sender that the message has been received.They have to go through all the above steps to send 
            their feedback to the earlier sender who is now the receiver. this is the most important step as it
            ensures completion of the cycle of communication.
        </p>
