      <p class="explain">
         There are two major types of communication: verbal and non-verbal communication. Verbal communication is the type of communication in which words are used either in oral or written form whereas non-verbal communication is the type of communication in which words are not used. There are five components in non-verbal communication which are given below:

      <p class="type">
         1. Kinesis:
      </p>

      <li class="points">
         In kinesis, the movement of our body conveys many different and specific meanings whose interpretation may be culture-bound. Since many of these movements occur unconsciously or subconsciously, there is a significantly larger risk of misinterpretation.
      </li>

      <li class="points">
         Kinesis includes facial expressions, hand movement, gestures, body language, etc.
      </li>

      <li class="points">
         Direct eye contact with the audience is essential for every speaker. A major barrier to face to face communication is the avoidance of eye contact. Similarly, body language and posture reflect greatly on spoken words. A straight and erect back conveys that person is confident while speaking, while a hunched back reflects poor confidence level, especially during interviews.
      </li>

      <p class="type">
         2. Proxemics:
      </p>

      <p class="points">
         Proxemics means distance. The measure of distance we keep from others, conveys the relationship we share with them or the subject we are discussing.
      </p>

      <li class="points">
         Intimate distance: contact to 18 inches
      </li>
      
      <li class="points">
         Personal distance: 18 inches to 5 feet
      </li>
      
      <li class="points">
         Social distance: 5 feet to 12 feet
      </li>
      
      <li class="points">
         Public distance: 12 feet to 25 feet
      </li>

      <p class="type">
         3. Chronemics:
      </p>

      <p class="points">
         Chronemics deal with time, pauses and stops which play a significant role while communicating.
      </p>

      <p class="type">
         4. Paralanguage:
      </p>

      <p class="points">
         Paralanguage deals with vocal qualities such as volume, tone, rate, pronunciation, pitch and intonation patterns. The quality and volume of the voice determines the effectiveness of the message.
      </p>

      <p class="type">
         5. Appearance:
      </p>

      <p class="points">
         The appearance of a person during the course of communication reflects upon the person's personality as well as effectiveness of the overall communication.
